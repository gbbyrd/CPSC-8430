### HW2 - Seq2Seq for caption generation

To run the test script that uses the pre-trained model checkpoint, run the following:
    $ hw2_seq2seq.sh data_folder_name output/output.txt

This will output the BLEU@1 evaluation of the trained model checkpoint.
It should be ~.68

### Training
To train the model, you must ensure that the model data is in a folder called 'MLDS_hw2_1_data'. 
I have hardcoded this path for training.

Run the following to train:
    $ python3 train.py
