CPSC-8430 - Project 1

This README will specify the process used to generate my results presented in the Homework 1 report.
It will be split into different parts, each corresponding to their own folder.

*** A requirements.txt FILE WAS INCLUDED TO CREATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT ***
*** YOU MUST BE INSIDE THE SPECIFIED FOLDER WHEN YOU RUN THESE COMMANDS FOR THEM TO WORK ***

*** YOU CAN DELETE THE FILES INSIDE INFO FOLDER DIRECTORIES (figures, model_data, checkpoints, etc.) BUT ***
*** DO NOT DELETE THE FOLDERS THEMSELVES ***

*** Part1: ***

Input your chosen function in the chosen_function variable at line 15 of main.py. A list of the functions can be found
at line 40 of main.py.
Define the path for the image file in line 38.

run the following command to generate the plot:
python3 main.py

The figures will be placed in the Part1/figures directory

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Part1_2: ***

The main.py file in this folder uses arguments to allow for user customization.

To get information on the arguments, run the following command:
python3 main.py -h

To generate the figures, run the following command:

python3 main.py --train --test --epochs 50

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Part2: ***

To generate figures to view the optimization process, run the following command:

python3 visualize_optimization_process.py --train --test --epochs 51 --model_type dnn_1

This will generate a pca_analysis.png figure

To generate figures from the two gradient norm experiments, run the following command:

python3 gradient_norm_experients.py

*** NEED TO ADD THE REST ***

*** Part3_clean: ***

To generate figures to view the analysis of a model's ability to fit random labels,
run the following command:

python3 fit_random_labels

To generate figures to view the analysis of the number of parameters vs generalization,
run the following command:

python3 num_param_vs_generalization.py --epochs 50

To generate figures to view the analysis of flatness vs generalization, run the following command:

python3 flatness_vs_generalization.py
